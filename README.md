# Hyperlinked Index MD Generator
### (or simplu Github Repo Table of Contents Generator)

## Description
The Hyperlinked Index MD Generator is a simple tool designed for creating structured and navigable markdown documents that serve as comprehensive indexes **(or table of contents)** for project directories. It's available both as a [web app](https://indexgen-36f07323a277.herokuapp.com/) and a [command-line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/aimanfatima/hyperlinked-index-md-generator/blob/main/cli), catering to user different preferences.

**Motivation for this project:** I maintain a repository where I push all my data structure and algorithm problems, as well as my LeetCode practice exercises. I wanted to use a navigable index as my README because I wished to see all the problems I've solved on the main GitHub project page. A hyperlinked table of contents seemed like a good idea, but I couldn't find any robust solution for it. Hence, I created this project.
